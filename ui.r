The precision of the effect size estimates was low (i.e., the intervals were wide), and the 95% CIs extended across a range that included a protective effect, no effect, and a risk effect. . Mirabelli et al. reported 89 prevalence ratios (PR) and these are reported in Additional file 1, and the same inference applies. Most prevalence ratio intervals included one, and no consistent dose-response effect was observed."),

When the metric for goat exposure was a density indicator (i.e., number of goats within 5 km of the subject’s residence) and the outcome metric was pneumonia, there was evidence of an association between higher goat density and lower respiratory disease. The prevalence OR for the highest goat density (17,191–20,960) was 1.68, which indicated an increased prevalence of disease. Although the precision was moderate, all of the values within the 95% CI were associated with increased prevalence. These apparently inconsistent findings were reported by the same authors in the same study population. One explanation is that different mechanisms lead to the development of pneumonia versus asthma."),

The authors used pneumonia as a potential Q fever-related outcome, because pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis among the notified Q fever patients in the Netherlands epidemic. The authors also noted that exposure to poultry was associated with increased prevalence odds of pneumonia. This association between goats and pneumonia was likely due to Q fever, rather than particulate or gaseous emissions. The overall risk of bias was serious for all of the studies that reported prevalence ORs as measures of association."),
